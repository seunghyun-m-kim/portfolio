# Databricks Legacy Migration

This project was completed for a governmental database modernization contract bid.

---

In this project, we aim to demonstrate a pipeline that extracts from a legacy database (MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server) and loads it into the Databricks Delta Lake Bronze layer. There is also a [Github Actions CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/seunghyun-m-kim/portfolio/tree/master/.github/workflows) that runs an automated integration test upon pull request prior to merging branches.
